# Refactor - Semantic HTML

## Context
As the world increasingly shifts to digital platforms, web semantics have become critical to ensure that search engines and assistive technologies can correctly interpret the content on a webpage. Semantically correct websites can enhance SEO rankings, improve accessibility, and overall, provide a better user experience.

Semantics in HTML can be a complex field, but your mentor has provided a specific set of requirements for this project. These requirements are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section below.

In order to excel as a web developer, you should always strive to improve the codebase beyond the given requirements. For example, ensure that all images are correctly referenced, and improve the CSS by consolidating selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and commenting before each element or section of the page.

Are you ready for the challenge? Here are the task requirements.

## User Story
**AS A** junior web developer<br/>
**I WANT** a codebase that adheres to semantic HTML principles<br/>
**SO THAT** the website is optimized for search engines and assistive technologies<br/>


## Task List
### Task 1: Refactor HTML with Semantic Elements
- The existing `index.html` uses general HTML tags
- Your task is to refactor the HTML, replacing general HTML tags with semantic HTML elements wherever possible

### Task 2: Ensure Logical Structure of HTML Elements
- The structure of the HTML elements should follow a logical sequence, independent of the CSS styling and positioning
- Confirm that your refactored HTMl maintains this logical structure

### Task 3: Provide Alt Attributes for Image Elements
- The HTML file includes an image
- Ensure this image has a relevant alt attribute, enhancing accessibility for users relying on screen readers.

### Task 4: Confirm Sequential Order of Heading Attributes
- The HTML file includes heading tags
- Confirm that the heading tags fall in a sequential order, improving document outline and accessibility

### Task 5: Refactor HTML with Semantic Elements
- The HTML file includes a `<title>` tag in the `<head>` section
- Ensure the title is concise, descriptive, and relevant to the content of the webpage



Each task aligns with the fundamental principles of semantic HTML, accessibility, and SEO-friendly practices. Once completed, the website should appear the same to the end user (as shown in the screenshot below), but the underlying code will be significantly improved. This will make it more efficient, accessible, and easier to maintain.

To help you complete this assignment, refer to the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) and other relevant resources you find on the internet.

Example semantic HTML tags: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`
